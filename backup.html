# Let's take a look at a simple Hyperledger Fabric business network.

....your first network (BYFN) scenario provisions a sample Hyperledger Fabric network 
consisting of two organizations, each maintaining two peer nodes, and a "solo" ordering service. 

A blockchain network is comprised primarily of: 

### 1. Fabric Certificate Authority (CA) hyperledger/fabric-ca (also known as Membership Service Provider)

https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html#overview

Every single operation in the Hyperledger Fabric must be signed by an X.509 certificate. 
The Fabric-ca certificate authority is used for generating X.509 certificates.

CA: Certificate Authority https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 
         Comment: It provides features such as:
         1. Issues certificates to other network participants to enroll in the network,
	       or connects to LDAP as the user registry
         2. issuance of Enrollment Certificates (ECerts)
         3. certificate renewal and revocation

### 2. A set of Peer nodes , or, simply, peers. Peers are a fundamental element of the network because they host ledgers and smart contracts. 

<img src="https://github.com/LennartFr/hyperlab20181018/blob/master/Peers.png">

Recall that a ledger immutably records all the transactions generated by smart contracts (or chaincode). 
Smart contracts and ledgers are used to encapsulate the shared processes and shared information in a network, respectively. 

1. The Fabric ledger is maintained by each peer and includes the blockchain and worldstate
1. A separate ledger is maintained for each channel the peer joins
1. Transaction read/write sets are written to the blockchain
1. Channel configurations are also written to the blockchain

### 3. Fabric Orderering service and Consensus
The heart of the consensus algorithm. Before anything is committed to the ledger it must pass thru the
ordering service.

Comment: The Hyperledger fabric ordering service is intended to provide an atomic broadcast 
ordering service for consumption by the peers. This means that many clients may 
submit messages for ordering, and all clients are delivered the same series of 
ordered batches in response.

       Comment: Transactions are collected into blocks/batches on the Ordering Service.
       The  blocks are stored locally to disk on every Ordering Service node 
       along with a LevelDB or CouchDB index to these blocks by number. 
       The blocks are delivered via RPC to committing peers. 
       The peers store them locally, and maintain a LevelDB (or CouchDB)based block index.
