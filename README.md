Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli c. 1447â€“1517) was an Italian mathematician, Franciscan friar, collaborator with Leonardo da Vinci, and a seminal contributor to the field now known as accounting. 

He is referred to as "The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping" in Europe and he was the first person to publish a work on the double-entry system of book-keeping in that continent.

### Blockchain Distributed Ledger  
  
<img src="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1.jpg">
<p> 
A distributed ledger is a type of database that is shared, replicated, and synchronized among the members of a network. The distributed ledger records the transactions, such as the exchange of assets or data, among the participants in the network.

Participants in the network govern and agree by consensus on the updates to the records in the ledger. No central, third-party mediator, such as a financial institution or clearinghouse, is involved.

Every record in the distributed ledger has a timestamp and unique crytographic signature, thus making the ledger an auditable history of all transactions in the network. One implementation of distributed ledger technology is the open source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.


# How did it all start?
 
October 2008 It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:

<i>
The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[17] In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several documents to be collected into one block.

A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. The first blockchain was conceptualised by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

<p>
<i>A blockchain is a decentralized virtual ledger for recording transactions <b>without central authority </b> through a distributed cryptographic protocol. It is made up of three technologies 

1. cryptographic algorithms, 
1. a distributed protocol, 
1. and replicated data 
<p>
which combined provide a trustworthy service to a group of nodes that do not fully trust each other.

# Section Three, Let's take a look at a simple Hyperledger Fabric business network.

....your first network (BYFN) scenario provisions a sample Hyperledger Fabric network 
consisting of two organizations, each maintaining two peer nodes, and a "solo" ordering service. 

A blockchain network is comprised primarily of: 

### 1. Fabric Certificate Authority (CA) hyperledger/fabric-ca (also known as Membership Service Provider)

https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html#overview

Every single operation in the Hyperledger Fabric must be signed by an X.509 certificate. 
The Fabric-ca certificate authority is used for generating X.509 certificates.

CA: Certificate Authority https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 
         Comment: It provides features such as:
         1. Issues certificates to other network participants to enroll in the network,
	       or connects to LDAP as the user registry
         2. issuance of Enrollment Certificates (ECerts)
         3. certificate renewal and revocation

### 2. A set of Peer nodes , or, simply, peers. Peers are a fundamental element of the network because they host ledgers and smart contracts. 

<img src="https://github.com/LennartFr/hyperlab20181018/blob/master/Peers.png">

Recall that a ledger immutably records all the transactions generated by smart contracts (or chaincode). 
Smart contracts and ledgers are used to encapsulate the shared processes and shared information in a network, respectively. 

1. The Fabric ledger is maintained by each peer and includes the blockchain and worldstate
1. A separate ledger is maintained for each channel the peer joins
1. Transaction read/write sets are written to the blockchain
1. Channel configurations are also written to the blockchain

<img src="https://github.com/LennartFr/hyperlab20181018/blob/master/Blockchain.png">

### 3. Fabric Orderering service and Consensus
The heart of the consensus algorithm. Before anything is committed to the ledger it must pass thru the
ordering service.

<img src="https://github.com/LennartFr/hyperlab20181018/blob/master/ordering.png">


<img src="https://github.com/LennartFr/hyperlab20181018/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-19%20at%2011.41.49.png">

Comment: The Hyperledger fabric ordering service is intended to provide an atomic broadcast 
ordering service for consumption by the peers. This means that many clients may 
submit messages for ordering, and all clients are delivered the same series of 
ordered batches in response.

       Comment: Transactions are collected into blocks/batches on the Ordering Service.
       The  blocks are stored locally to disk on every Ordering Service node 
       along with a LevelDB or CouchDB index to these blocks by number. 
       The blocks are delivered via RPC to committing peers. 
       The peers store them locally, and maintain a LevelDB (or CouchDB)based block index.
